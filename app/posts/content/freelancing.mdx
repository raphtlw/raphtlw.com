this page outlines my "guidelines" when it comes to freelancing.

few rules:
- prioritize iterative development
- be upfront with pricing and time-to-live expectations
- provide regular updates via email

the three things above is what i can promise a client when i take on a project.

in my experience, the challenge with freelancing is not the work, but setting expectations, planning and scheduling.

therefore, before i start work on any project, i set aside ample time to understand a client's needs and what works best for their situation, then provide a timeline, and a clear, fixed price.

this ensures transparency between the client's investment and i, leaving no room for surprises.

## FAQ

### Do you accept all projects?

Nope. I only take on projects if I'm confident that the value you get from my services exceeds your investment.

### How long does a project take?

Projects usually range from 2 weeks to 3 months. If there are any additional monthly costs which may incur after completion, I always let the client know beforehand. The monthly costs may include server bills, or additional feedback loops.

### What's your schedule like?

I have classes, so my time for freelancing is limited. I currently only take on one project at a time.

### Limited technical knowledge?

I believe projects are fundamentally the products that come out of it. These days, prioritizing communication and planning is more important to me. If a project aligns with my values and knowledge, I will do whatever I can to follow it to completion, and that includes outsourcing talent when I need to.
